This document holds a basic plan/layout for a completed
SongOfTime utility.

The SongOfTime utility interacts with several hidden files stored
on in the users home directory.  Using home directory storage should
allow users to remain separate on multi user computers.  These two
files and their usage are discussed below.

.timeSong.html
--------------
This file is used to hold the list of all tasks.
The information for each task should be..."
"TaskName	TotalTimeOpened		LastTouched(Date)".
This information is stored in addition to section headers

A sample file is shown delimited by file tags below:
<FILE>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Task Data</h2>
<pre>
\"Worked On SoT\"	1 hour, 15 minutes	December 16, 2012
\"Goofed off on Chrome\"	0 hours, 15 minutes	December 15, 2012
\"Started Pandora\"	0 hours, 0 minutes	December 17, 2012
</pre>
</body>
</html>
</FILE>


.curTask.sot
------------
This file is used simply to hold the current task in and start time.
It is used only for a task that has been open, but not closed.
It should only contain a single line.

Should be formatted as:
"TaskName	TimeOpenedInMillis	DataStamp(?)"

.allTasks.sot
-------------
This file is used to hold all tasks since the beginning of time.
It is a binary file holding directly written task structs.



Questions:
----------
1)How can I get the home directory in C++?
2)Is there a standard date object I can use in C++?
